# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
there were several moments that were fairly frustrating, but also incredibly rewarding as I overcame the challenges. I had to reach out for some help a couple times, and I think I spent more time on google than in vs, but I think methods and oop really solidified the concepts we've learned so far for me.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
I'm definitely staying focused, and getting better at making sure that my struggles are productive. I do need to be better about taking breaks, but I've got those scheduled now, so that's helping. I've also managed to handle all my personal responsibilities while still completing my assignments on time.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
Be very careful with syntax, I made several errors, from capitalizing the wrong words, to trying to pass strings into methods that called for integers. This really made me get more comfortable with reading the error codes my terminal was returning and trying to deduce what needed to change to fix it. It also made me get more comfortable with discussing the errors I was having in technical language.
